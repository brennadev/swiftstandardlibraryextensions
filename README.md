Extensions with Methods and Properties I've Added to Swift Standard Library Types

This is a collection of Swift class/struct extensions to add functionality to Swift Standard Library structs. I've used these methods to either simplify functionality of Swift Standard Library code in my projects. See the documentation in each file for more detailed information on the methods and properties added. More extensions may be added in the future.

#### Compatibility
* Xcode 9.4 or later
* iOS 11.4 or later
  * May work with previous iOS versions (by changing the deployment target) but hasn't been tested with those versions

#### See Also
I have a separate framework with extensions on UIKit types [here](https://github.com/brennadev/uikitextensions).

#### Note to Potential Employers
Please contact me if you'd like to see more of the work I've done with this framework as I don't want to make it all public.
